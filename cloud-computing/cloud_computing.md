# Cloud Computing

## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of computer power; database storage, applications and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go pricing**
- You can **provision exactly the right type and size of computing** resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**
- Simple way to access **servers, storage, databases** and a set of **application services**

## The deployment models of cloud

- Private Cloud: (Rackspace)
    - Cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to the public
    - Complete control
    - Security for sensitive applications
    - Meet specific business

- Public Cloud: (Azue, GCP and AWS)
    - Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the Internet

- Hybrid Cloud:
    - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
    - Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- On-demand self service:
    - Users can provision resources and use them without huma intersaction from the service provider
- Broad network access:
    - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Multi-tenancy and resource pooling:
    - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
    - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
- Rapid elasticity and scalability:
    - Automatically andn quickly acquire and dispose resources 

## Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: Change resources types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what you use
- Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## Types of Cloud Computing

- Infrastracture as a Service (IaaS)
    - Provide building blocks for cloud IT
    - Provide networking, computers, data storage space
    - Highest level of flexibility
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
