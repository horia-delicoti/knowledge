# Procrastination

## Rules

Getting things done, by David Allen

```sh
If an action will take less than two minutes, it should be done at the moment it's defined
```

When you try to do something that you really don't want to do, simplify the task down to 2 minutes or less. Atomic Habits

```sh
A habit needs to be established before it can be expanded upon.
```
